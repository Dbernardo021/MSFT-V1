# Distress Messaging System Implementation

## Overview
Implementation of bidirectional messaging system between 911 dispatch and officers in distress based on elevated vital signs monitoring.

## Architecture

### Frontend Components
- **Dispatch Interface**: Send status check messages to officers
- **Officer Response Interface**: Receive messages and respond with OK/custom messages
- **Real-time Communication**: WebSocket integration for instant messaging
- **Alert Integration**: Connect with existing vital signs monitoring

### Backend Components
- **Message API**: Handle message sending/receiving
- **WebSocket Server**: Real-time communication
- **Vital Signs Integration**: Trigger messaging on elevated vitals
- **Officer Status Management**: Track officer responses

## Features

### For Dispatch
1. **Status Check Messages**: Send "Are you OK?" messages to officers with elevated vitals
2. **Custom Messages**: Send personalized status check messages
3. **Response Monitoring**: View officer responses in real-time
4. **Alert Integration**: Automatic messaging triggers from vital signs alerts

### For Officers
1. **Message Reception**: Receive status check messages on mobile/wearable devices
2. **Quick Response**: One-click "I'm OK" button
3. **Custom Response**: Send personalized status messages
4. **Emergency Context**: Clear indication of distress situation

## Technical Implementation

### Real-time Communication
- WebSocket connection for instant messaging
- Fallback to Server-Sent Events if needed
- Message queuing for offline scenarios

### Integration Points
- Existing vital signs monitoring system
- Officer profile management
- Emergency alert infrastructure
- Mobile/wearable app interfaces

## API Endpoints

### Message Management
- `POST /api/messages/send` - Send message to officer
- `GET /api/messages/officer/{id}` - Get messages for officer
- `POST /api/messages/respond` - Officer response to message
- `GET /api/messages/dispatch` - Get all dispatch messages

### WebSocket Events
- `message_sent` - New message sent to officer
- `message_received` - Officer received message
- `response_sent` - Officer responded to message
- `vital_alert` - Elevated vitals detected (trigger messaging)

## Security Considerations
- Encrypted message transmission
- Officer authentication required
- Dispatch authorization checks
- Emergency context validation

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for message API
- Integration tests for WebSocket communication
- End-to-end tests for complete messaging flow
- Load testing for emergency scenarios
